Let’s say you typed a word in your keyboard if the word will exist in the vocabulary of our smartphone then it will assume that you have written the right word. Now it doesn’t matter whether you write a name, a noun or any word on the planet.\n","\n","If the word exists in the history of the smartphone, it will generalize the word as a correct word.

Now let’s get started with the task to build an autocorrect with Python.\n","\n","For this task, we need some libraries.
